			<p><strong>Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games</strong>, or MMORPGs, blend the genres of <strong>role-playing video games</strong> and <strong>massively multiplayer online games</strong>, usually in the form of web browser-based games, in which a very large number of players interact with one another within a virtual world.</p>
		
			<p>The player assumes the role of a character, which often takes place in a fantasy	or science fiction world, and takes control over many of that character's actions.  MMORPGs are different than single-player or smaller multi-player online <abbr title="Role-Playing Games">RPGs</abbr> by the number of players able to interact together, and by the game's world which continues to exist and evolve while the player is away from the game.</p>
		
			<p id="one"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Some common features of MMORPGs are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Themes</li>
				<li>Progression</li>
				<li>Social interaction</li>
				<li>Role Playing</li>
				<li>Culture</li>
				<li>System architecture</li>

			<p><strong>Facebook</strong> brought along its popularization of microtransactions 
			and has also paved the way for a new wave of <strong>Flash</strong> and <strong>HTML5</strong>
			based MMORPGs that use the free to play model.  These games require no downloading 
			outside of the web browser and usually have heavily integrated social media sharing features.</p>
