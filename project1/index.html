		<p><strong>Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games</strong>, or MMORPGs, 
		blend the genres of <strong>role-playing video games</strong> and <strong>massively 
		multiplayer online games</strong>, usually in the form of we browser-based games, 
		in which a very large number of players interact with one another within a virtual world.</p>
		
		<p>The player assumes the role of a character, which often takes place in a fantasy
		or science fiction world, and takes control over many of that character's actions.
		MMORPGs are different than single-player or smaller multi-player online <abbr 
		title="Role-Playing Games">RPGs</abbr> by the
		number of players able to interact together, and by the game's world which continues
		to exist and evolve while the player is away from the game.</p>
